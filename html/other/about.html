                    <h5>Founder</h5>
                    <p>I am a fourth-year medical student, based in Sydney, Australia, with a passion for the field of radiology. This passion led to the creation of "Ready for Radiology", where I aim to share my jounrey trying to become a radiologist with others by teaching anatomy, physics, and the basics of image interpretation. One day I hope to be a specialised radiologist in Australia, and as I undertake this journey, I hope I can inspire and teach others along the way.</p>

                        <p>Radiologists need to be excellent at paying attention to detail. We recognise this and strive to provide detailed articles sharing the information you need to know while prepaing for radiology exams.</p>
