            <div class="about-container">
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to empower aspiring radiologists with the knowledge needed to start preparing for a career in this exciting area of medicine. We strive to make radiology education accessible, engaging, and effective for everyone, even those who are not interested in radiology! We would love for others with a passion for radiology, anatomy, or physics, to also get involved. If you want to contribute through either writing an article or providing contructive feedback, we would love to hear from you!</p>

                    <h5>Founder</h5>
                    <p>I am a fourth-year medical student, based in Sydney, Australia, with a passion for the field of radiology. This passion led to the creation of "Ready for Radiology", where I aim to share my journey trying to become a radiologist with others by teaching anatomy, physics, and the basics of image interpretation. One day I hope to be a specialised radiologist in Australia, and as I work towards this, I hope I can inspire and teach others along the way.</p>

                        <h3>Attention to Detail</h3>
                        <p>Radiologists need to be excellent at paying attention to detail. We recognise this and strive to provide detailed articles sharing the information you need to know while prepaing for radiology exams.</p>
